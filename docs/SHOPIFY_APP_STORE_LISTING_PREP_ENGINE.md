## App category

- **Primary category:** Choose the one that best matches. Recommended: **Fulfillment** or **Order management** (Prep Engine connects stores for inventory, orders, and prep/fulfillment). Use Shopify’s [list of categories](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-store/listing-in-the-app-store/app-categories) and [category guidelines](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-store/listing-in-the-app-store/app-categories#category-guidelines) to confirm.
- **Secondary category (optional):** If the form allows and it fits, **Inventory management** is a good second choice. Subject to review.

- **First plan (Free) – suggested values:**
  - **Internal plan handle:** `free` (max 30 chars; used in code, can't be changed later).
  - **Billing:** If the app is free, choose a free option if the dropdown has one, or keep **Monthly charge** and **Yearly charge** at **$0**.
