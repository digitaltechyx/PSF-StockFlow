2. Click **+ Create Credentials** at the top
3. Select **Service Account** from the dropdown
4. Fill in the form:
   - **Service account name**: `psf-stockflow-drive` (or any name)

   - Click **Continue** or **Done**

   - Click **Done**

---

### Step 5: Download JSON Key File

1. You should now see your service account in the list
2. Click on the **service account email** (looks like: `psf-stockflow-drive@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
3. Go to the **Keys** tab (at the top)
4. Click **Add Key** → **Create new key**
5. Select **JSON** format
6. Click **Create**
7. **IMPORTANT**: A JSON file will automatically download to your computer!
   - Save this file in a safe place
   - You'll need it in the next steps

---

### Step 6: Share Your Personal Google Drive Folder

**Important**: This works with your **personal Google Drive** (the one with 2TB storage)! No Google Workspace needed!

1. Open the downloaded JSON file (it's a text file, open with Notepad or any text editor)
2. Find the line that says `"client_email"` (looks like: `"client_email": "psf-stockflow-drive@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"`)
3. **Copy the email address** (the part in quotes after `client_email`)
   - Example: `psf-stockflow-drive@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

4. Go to **[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)** (your personal account with 2TB storage)
5. **Create a new folder** (or use an existing folder) where you want to store the labels
   - Right-click → **New Folder** → Name it `PSF Labels` (or any name)
6. **Right-click the folder** → **Share**
7. In the "Add people and groups" box, **paste the service account email** you copied
8. Click the **dropdown** next to the email → Select **Editor**
9. **Uncheck** "Notify people" (optional, since it's a service account)
10. Click **Share** or **Send**

**Result**: Files will be uploaded to your **personal Google Drive** (2TB storage) in the folder you shared!

**Important**: Service accounts don't have storage quota, so you MUST share a folder from your personal Google Drive. Files uploaded to the shared folder will count against your personal account's quota (2TB).

---

### Step 6.5: Get the Folder ID

1. After sharing the folder, open the folder in Google Drive
2. Look at the URL in your browser - it will look like:
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p
   ```
3. **Copy the folder ID** (the long string after `/folders/`)
   - Example: `1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p`
4. You'll need this for the next step

---

### Step 7: Set Environment Variables

1. Open the downloaded JSON file again
2. **Copy the ENTIRE content** (everything from `{` to `}`)
3. The JSON should look like this:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "...",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "psf-stockflow-drive@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "...",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "..."
}
```

4. Copy **all of it** (Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+C)

#### For Local Development (.env.local)

1. Open your `.env.local` file in the project root
2. Add this line:

```env
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY='{"type":"service_account","project_id":"...","private_key":"...","client_email":"..."}'
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p
```

**Important**: 
- Replace the `...` with the actual JSON content you copied
- Replace `1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p` with your actual folder ID from Step 6.5
- Use **single quotes** around the JSON
- Make sure the JSON is all on **one line**

**OR** if you prefer, you can format it like this (but it must be on one line):

```env
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY="{\"type\":\"service_account\",\"project_id\":\"...\",\"private_key\":\"...\",\"client_email\":\"...\"}"
```

#### For Vercel (Production)

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Click **Add New**
5. Add two environment variables:
   - **Name**: `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
     - **Value**: Paste the entire JSON content (all of it)
   - **Name**: `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`
     - **Value**: Paste your folder ID from Step 6.5
6. Select environments: **Production**, **Preview**, **Development** (all of them)
7. Click **Save** for each variable

---

### Step 8: Deploy and Test

1. Commit and push your changes
2. Deploy to your hosting platform (Vercel)
3. Go to your application's **Labels** page
4. Click **Upload Labels**
5. Select a PDF file
6. Click **Upload**
7. Check your Google Drive folder - the file should appear in the correct folder structure!

## 📁 Where Files Will Be Stored

Files will be stored in your **personal Google Drive** in this structure:

```
Your Google Drive/
  └── PSF Labels/  (the folder you shared)
      └── 2024/
          └── January/
              └── Client Name/
                  └── 2024-01-15/
                      └── label.pdf
```

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **User uploads label** → No login needed for users
2. **Your app** → Uses service account to upload to Google Drive
3. **Service account** → Has access to the folder you shared
4. **Files appear** → In your personal Google Drive (2TB storage)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Google Drive credentials not configured"

**Solution**: 
- Make sure `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` is set in your `.env.local` file
- Restart your development server after adding the variable
- Check that it's also set in Vercel environment variables

### Error: "Invalid GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY format"

**Solution**: 
- Make sure the JSON is valid
- Check that all quotes are properly escaped
- Try copying the JSON again from the downloaded file
- Make sure the entire JSON is on one line

### Error: "Permission denied" or "File not found"

**Solution**: 
- Make sure you shared the Google Drive folder with the service account email
- Check that the service account has **Editor** permissions
- Verify the `client_email` in your JSON matches the email you shared with
- Make sure you shared the correct folder

### Files not appearing in Google Drive

**Solution**:
- Check the API route logs for errors
- Verify the service account has access to the folder
- Make sure Google Drive API is enabled in your Google Cloud project
- Check that the folder was shared correctly

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit the JSON key file to Git**
   - Add `*.json` to `.gitignore` if you haven't already
   - The key is stored only in environment variables

2. **Restrict Service Account Permissions**
   - Only give the service account access to the specific folder you need
   - Don't give it access to your entire Google Drive

3. **Rotate Keys Regularly**
   - Periodically create new keys and update environment variables
   - Delete old keys from Google Cloud Console

4. **Monitor Usage**
   - Check Google Cloud Console for API usage
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity
